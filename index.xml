      <description>The Golden State Warriors started off the season without Klay Thompson, but still showed dominance without him with Jordan Poole stepping up from the three point line. With Stephen Curry also breaking the record of most three pointers made in a career and is still continuing to increase that number.
The Golden State Warriors has a backcourt duo that can catch fire from three at any point in the game.</description>

      <description>The real question is was Bryce McGowens snubbed from winning the Big Ten Freshman player of the year? The reason why he probably didn’t win the Freshman player of the year could be from how poorly the Nebraska basketball 2021-2022 season was.
The winner of the Big Ten freshman player of the year was Malaki Branham, a player from Ohio State, but here’s the thing Ohio State was better than Nebraska.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>Hello my name is Noah Tassello. I am a Junior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and studying sports media and communication. I&amp;rsquo;ve been practicing coding for a month and a half almost two months now and getting better at it. The data I&amp;rsquo;ve been using is sports data to find certain stats during that game or season. I could honestly see myself doing this as a future, if you put in the time to practice.</description>
